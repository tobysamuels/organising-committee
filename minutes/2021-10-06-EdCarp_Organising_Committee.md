Minutes - circulated via Zoom chat (no comments)
Document defining roles and responsibilities within the committee (see below)

## Notes from 06OCT2021

There is no exsting document defining the roles and responsibilitis for the committee or members of the committee.
There did not appear to be a need for formal roles within the committee, beyond someone to organise the meetings (currently Steve Ford)
There are 'activities' that the committee should be doing: Update the website/organising the community events/link role with departments.
In the past these have been done 'naturally' or 'informally', by people who position allowed them to do so.

However, there was a desire to:
1. draft a document outlining the roles of the steering and organising committees.
2. draft a statement (or perhaps a mission statement) outlining what the organising committee does and what its responsible for.
3. survey the committee to collect ideas (see 'Committee member survey' section below) with a view the drawing up a statement

Committee meeting frequency - 6-8 weeks or 1-2 months was the frequency expressed by the committee members

## Plans for workshops:
Magnus is trying to organise a geoscience workshop for Dec/Jan
Juan is trying to organise a DC workshop for Dec/Jan
Tahira reported a ed-DASH workshop for 27th October

It was felt that if the following link could be used/updated with a list of planned workshops. 
This would allow committee members to see what workshops are planned.

At some point the list will be transfered to github.

## AOB
Steve to organise the next meeting for early December. 

# Committee member survey

Can each committee member add to the list below answers to the following questions:
1. what does the committee do?
2. what can you do? 
3. what the committee can do for you? 
4. your work/location role?

### Steve Ford: 
The committee plans SWC/DC/LC workshops and meets to exchange ideas and seek helpers and instructors
I can help with the meeting planning and workshops
The committee can act as a connection to others involved in HE/science research education
I live in Glasgow and work at the Uni of Strathclyde.

### Evgenij Belikov:
1. The focus of the organising committee is on building local and Scotland-wide Carpentries communities through the following: organising Carpentries workshops, organising Instructor Trainings, Community events (recruiting new helpers and instructors), liaising with relevant university bodies to join Carpentries as a Member institution, connecting with different Programming/Data Science initiatives across schools/departments. Another goal, which is now perhaps better covered by the steering committee, is to connect with decision makers at the universities to increase recognition and ask for further support of our efforts.
2. I can primarily help with running Carpentries and Instructor Training workshops.
3. Committee has always been a source of ideas, knowledge and motivation. 
4. I live in Edinburgh and work at the Uni of Edinburgh.


### Graeme Grimes
1. The committee plans SWC/DC/LC workshops and meets to exchange ideas and seek helpers and instructors.
2. I can help with the meeting planning and workshops at the IGC.
3. Helps me keep up to-date with Ed-Carp activities and get helpers for Carpentries courses.
4. I live in Edinburgh and work at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, College of Medicine,  Uni of Edinburgh.

### Toby Samuels
1. The committee enables information/idea sharing and communication to facilitate SWC, DC and LC workshops, primarily through attracting helpers and instructors. Effective communication and information sharing through the creation and maintenance of shared documents allows planning several months in advance to be achieved and redundant repetition of workshops to be avoid (i.e. foster collaboration between interested instructors/helpers). 
2. I am new to the committee and do yet have experience of helping/instructoring on any Carpentry workshops. I am looking for opportunities to be a helper on Data Carpentry workshops that run in R. I am also interested in training to become a workshop instructor.  
3. In my role as a Researcher Development Coordinator at Heriot-Watt University, it is my responsibility to provide access to training on data analysis and software design/management to researchers (PhD, Post-Doc, Academic Staff) within HWU. I am looking a) for upcoming workshops that are openly available which I can advertise to students/staff at HWU and b) to find instructors and helpers within this community to help organise workshops that HWU students/staff can attend.
4. I live in Edinburgh and work at the Research Futures Academy, Heriot Watt University.
